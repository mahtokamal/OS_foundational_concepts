# 1.0 Introduction

The use of mobile devices has grown very rapidly. IT technicians and professionals must be familiar with the operating systems on these devices. Like desktops and laptops, mobile devices also use operating systems to interface with the hardware and to run software. The two most commonly used mobile operating systems are Android and iOS.

In this module, you will learn about the components, functions, and terminology related to mobile operating systems. You will learn about the differences between the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, Android being open source and customizable, and iOS being proprietary to Apple and closed source. You will also learn about common mobile device features like screen orientation, screen calibration, Wi-Fi calling, virtual assistants, and GPS. You will work with both the Android and iOS operating systems as part of lab exercises.

The portable nature of mobile devices makes them at risk for theft and loss. You will learn about mobile security features such as screen lock, biometric authentication, remote lock, remote wipe, and patching and upgrading. You also learned that mobile OSs can be configured to disable access if too many failed login attempts are made. This can prevent someone from trying to guess a passcode. Most mobile devices also have a remote lock and remote wipe feature that can be activated if the device is stolen. 

# 1.1 Android versus iOS
# 1.1.1 Open Source Versus Closed Source

Like desktops and laptops, mobile devices use an operating system (OS) to run the software. This chapter focuses on the two most commonly used mobile operating systems: Android and iOS. Google develops Android, and Apple develops iOS.

Before users can analyze and modify software, they must be able to see the source code. Source code is the sequence of instructions written in human-readable language before it is turned into machine language (zeroes and ones). The source code is an essential component of free software as it allows the users to analyze and eventually modify the code. The software is said to be open source when the developer chooses to provide the source code. The software is said to be closed-source if the program’s source code is not published.

**Android GUI**

Android is an open source, Linux based smartphone/tablet operating system developed by the Open Handset Alliance, primarily driven by Google. Released in 2008 on the HTC Dream, the Android OS has been customized for use on a wide range of electronic devices. Because Android is open and customizable, programmers can use it to operate devices like laptops, smart TVs, and e-book readers. There have even been Android installations in devices like cameras, navigation systems, and portable media players. The figure shows Android running on a tablet.

**iOS GUI**

iOS is a closed source Unix based operating system for Apple’s iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet. Released in 2007 on the first iPhone, the Apple iOS source code was not released to the public. To copy, modify or redistribute iOS requires permission from Apple. The figure shows iOS running on an iPhone.

**Windows 10 Mobile**

iOS is not the only closed source OS for mobile devices. Microsoft also created a version of Windows for their mobile devices. This includes Windows CE, Windows Phone 7, shown in the figure, and Windows Phone 8. With the development of Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft provides a very similar user interface and use of code an all of their devices. This includes their Windows 10 Mobile phones and tablets they develop under the name Surface.

# 1.1.2 Application and Content Sources

Apps are programs that are executed on mobile devices. Apps are written and compiled for a specific mobile operating system such as Apple iOS, Android, or Windows. Mobile devices come with several different apps preinstalled to provide basic functionality. There are apps to make phone calls, send and receive an email, listen to music, take pictures, and play video or video games.
Apps are used on mobile devices in the same way programs are used on computers. Instead of being installed from an optical disk, apps are downloaded from a content source. Some apps can be downloaded for free, and others must be purchased.

**iOS Apps**

Apps for Apple iOS mobile devices are available for free or purchase from the App Store. Apple uses a walled garden model for their apps meaning the apps must be submitted to and approved by Apple before they are released to users. This helps prevent the spread of malware and malicious code. Third-party developers can create apps for iOS devices by using Apple’s Software Development Kit (SDK) Xcode and the Swift programming language. Note that Xcode can only be installed on computers running OS X.

**Android Apps**

Android apps are available from both Google PlayTM and third-party sites, such as Amazon’s App store. Android Studio, a Java-based SDK, is available on Linux, Windows, and OS X. Android apps run in a sandbox and have only the privileges enabled by the user. A prompt will appear if an app needs to obtain permissions. Permissions are granted via the app’s Settings page.
Third-party or custom programs are installed directly using an Android Application Package (apk) file. This gives users the ability to directly install apps without going through the storefront interface. This is known as sideloading. Click each image below for more information on apps.

**Automobile Apps**

Many new cars have navigation built into them. Some also have what is known as in-vehicle entertainment systems. A growing trend is using many apps on your mobile device through this entertainment system. Your tablet or smartphone is connected to the system via USB or Bluetooth to enable what is known as Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Navigation is one of the most common uses for this connection. You can also access the music on your mobile device and play it over the car stereo. Other features include talk-to-text, hands-free calling, access to digital assistants, and a display of your calendar contents.

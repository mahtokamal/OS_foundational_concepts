# 1.0 Introduction

The use of mobile devices has grown very rapidly. IT technicians and professionals must be familiar with the operating systems on these devices. Like desktops and laptops, mobile devices also use operating systems to interface with the hardware and to run software. The two most commonly used mobile operating systems are Android and iOS.

In this module, you will learn about the components, functions, and terminology related to mobile operating systems. You will learn about the differences between the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, Android being open source and customizable, and iOS being proprietary to Apple and closed source. You will also learn about common mobile device features like screen orientation, screen calibration, Wi-Fi calling, virtual assistants, and GPS. You will work with both the Android and iOS operating systems as part of lab exercises.

The portable nature of mobile devices makes them at risk for theft and loss. You will learn about mobile security features such as screen lock, biometric authentication, remote lock, remote wipe, and patching and upgrading. You also learned that mobile OSs can be configured to disable access if too many failed login attempts are made. This can prevent someone from trying to guess a passcode. Most mobile devices also have a remote lock and remote wipe feature that can be activated if the device is stolen.

### 1.1.4 Operating System Vulnerabilities
Since OS is a System Software that consists of millions line of codes and some code might have vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities are design flaw or weakness that an attacker can take adavantage of these flaws using some tools and techniques to exploit the System. The main goal is to gain unauthorized access for malicious or illegal purposes such
as manipulation or stealing of data, changing permission or ownerships.

Following are the some of the common Windows OS security recommendations:-
1. Virus or Malware Protection
   - By default, Windows uses Windows Defender for malware protection.
   - Windows Defender provides a suite of protection tools built into the system.
   - If Windows Defender is turned off, the system becomes more vulnerable to attacks and malware.
2. Unknown or unmanaged services
   - There are many services that run behind the scenes.
   - It is important to make sure that each service is identifiable and safe.
   - With an unknown service running in the background, the computer can be vulnerable to attack.
3. Encryptions
   - When data is not encrypted, it can easily be gathered and exploited.
   - This is not only important for desktop computers, but especially mobile devices.
4. Security Policy
   - A good security policy must be configured and followed.
   - Many settings in the Windows Security Policy control can prevent attacks.
5. Firewall
    - By default, Windows uses Windows Firewall to limit communication with devices on the network.
    - Over time, rules may no longer apply.
    - For example, a port may be left open that should no longer be readily available.
    - It is important to review firewall settings periodically to ensure that the rules are still applicable and remove any 
      that no longer apply
6. File and Share Permission
    - These permissions must be set correctly.
    - It is easy to just give the “Everyone” group Full Control, but this allows all people to do what they want to all 
      files.
    - It is best to provide each user or group with the minimum necessary permissions for all files and folders.
8. Weak or no password
    - Many people choose weak passwords or do not use a password at all.
    - It is especially important to make sure that all accounts, especially the Administrator account, have a very strong 
      password.
13. Login as Administrator
    - When a user logs in as an administrator, any program that they run will have the privileges of that account.
    - It is best to log in as a Standard User and only use the administrator password to accomplish certain tasks.

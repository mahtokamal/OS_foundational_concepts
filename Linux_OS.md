# 1.1.1 What is Linux ?

Linux is an operating system that was created in 1991. Linux is open source, fast, reliable, and small. It requires very little hardware resources to run and is highly customizable. Unlike other operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X, Linux was created, and is currently maintained by, a community of programmers. Linux is part of several platforms and can be found on devices anywhere from “wristwatches to supercomputers”.

Another important aspect of Linux is that it is designed to be connected to the network, which makes it much simpler to write and use network-based applications. Because Linux is open source, any person or company can get the kernel’s source code, inspect it, modify it, and re-compile it at will. They are also allowed to redistribute the program with or without charges.

A Linux distribution is the term used to describe packages created by different organizations. Linux distributions (or distros) include the Linux kernel with customized tools and software packages. While some of these organizations may charge for their Linux distribution support (geared towards Linux-based businesses), the majority of them also offer their distribution for free without support. Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, CentOS, and SUSE are just a few examples of Linux distributions.

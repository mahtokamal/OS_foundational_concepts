# 1.0 Introduction

Linux is an open-source operating system that is fast, powerful, and highly customizable. It is built for network use as either a client or server. Linux is well-loved by a large community of users, including cybersecurity personnel.

Linux is an operating system that was created in 1991. Linux is open source, fast, reliable, and small. It requires very little hardware resources to run and is highly customizable. Unlike other operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS X, Linux was created, and is currently maintained by, a community of programmers. Linux is part of several platforms and can be found on devices anywhere from “wristwatches to supercomputers”.

Another important aspect of Linux is that it is designed to be connected to the network, which makes it much simpler to write and use network-based applications. Because Linux is open source, any person or company can get the kernel’s source code, inspect it, modify it, and re-compile it at will. They are also allowed to redistribute the program with or without charges.

A Linux distribution is the term used to describe packages created by different organizations. Linux distributions (or distros) include the Linux kernel with customized tools and software packages. While some of these organizations may charge for their Linux distribution support (geared towards Linux-based businesses), the majority of them also offer their distribution for free without support. Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, CentOS, and SUSE are just a few examples of Linux distributions.

# 1.1.2 The Value of Linux

Linux is often the operating system of choice in the Security Operations Center (SOC). These are some of the reasons to choose Linux:

- Linux is open source - Any person can acquire Linux at no charge and modify it to fit specific needs. This flexibility allows analysts and administrators to tailor-build an operating system specifically for security analysis.

- The Linux CLI is very powerful - While a GUI makes many tasks easier to perform, it adds complexity and requires more computer resources to run. The Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) is extremely powerful and enables analysts to perform tasks not only directly on a terminal, but also remotely.

- The user has more control over the OS - The administrator user in Linux, known as the root user, or superuser, has absolute power over the computer. Unlike other operating systems, the root user can modify any aspect of the computer with a few keystrokes. This ability is especially valuable when working with low level functions such as the network stack. It allows the root user to have precise control over the way network packets are handled by the operating system.

- It allows for better network communication control - Control is an inherent part of Linux. Because the OS can be adjusted in practically every aspect, it is a great platform for creating network applications. This is the same reason that many great network-based software tools are available for Linux only.

# 1.1.3 Linux in the SOC

The flexibility provided by Linux is a great feature for the SOC. The entire operating system can be tailored to become the perfect security analysis platform. For example, administrators can add only the necessary packages to the OS, making it lean and efficient. Specific software tools can be installed and configured to work in conjunction, allowing administrators to build a customized computer that fits perfectly in the workflow of a SOC.

The figure shows Sguil, which is the cybersecurity analyst console in a special version of Linux called Security Onion. Security Onion is an open source suite of tools that work together for network security analysis.

# 1.1.4 Linux Tools

In addition to SOC-specific tools, Linux computers that are used in the SOC often contain penetration testing tools. Also known as PenTesting, a penetration test is the process of looking for vulnerabilities in a network or computer by attacking it. Packet generators, port scanners, and proof-of-concept exploits are examples of PenTesting tools.

Kali Linux is a Linux distribution groups many penetration tools together in a single Linux distribution. Kali contains a great selection of tools. The figure shows a screenshot of Kali Linux. Notice all the major categories of penetration testing tools.

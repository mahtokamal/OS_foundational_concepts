# 1.1.1 Wireless Data Networks

The ability of a laptop, tablet, or cell phone to wirelessly connect to the internet has provided people with the freedom to work, learn, communicate, and play wherever they want.

Mobile devices typically have two wireless internet connectivity options:

- Wi-Fi - Wireless network connections use local Wi-Fi settings.
- Cellular - Wireless network connections are fee-provided using cellular data. Cellular networks require cellular towers and satellites to create a mesh of global coverage. A cellular data network connection can become expensive without an appropriate service plan.

You may need to register a device with a carrier or provide some unique identifier. Every mobile device has a unique 15-digit number called an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This number identifies the device to a carrier's network. The numbers come from a family of devices called the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The number is found in the device's configuration settings or a battery compartment if the battery is removable.

A unique number called the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) identifies the device user. The IMSI is often programmed on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card or can be programmed on the mobile device itself, depending on the network type.

Wi-Fi is usually preferred over a cellular connection because it is typically free. Wi-Fi radios use less battery power than cellular radios, so the device battery should last longer using Wi-Fi.

Many businesses, organizations, and locations also offer free Wi-Fi connections to attract customers. For example, coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, and even public transportation may offer free Wi-Fi access to users. Educational institutions have also adopted Wi-Fi connectivity. For instance, college campuses enable students to connect their mobile devices to the college network, sign up for classes, watch lectures, and submit assignments.

# 1.1.2 Wi-Fi Manual Configuration

It is essential to secure home Wi-Fi networks. Precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices:

- Enable security on home networks. Always enable the highest Wi-Fi security framework possible. Currently, WPA2 security is the most secure.
- Never send login or password information using clear, unencrypted text.
- Use a secure VPN connection when possible.

Devices can connect automatically or manually to Wi-Fi networks.

# 1.1.4 Cellular Communications Standards

Cell phones were introduced in the mid-1980s. Back then, cell phones were bigger and bulkier. It was also difficult and expensive to call people on another cellular network because there were few industry standards for cellular technology. Without standards, interoperability between cell phone manufacturers was very difficult.

Industry standards have simplified interconnectivity between cell providers. These standards have also made it less expensive to use cellular technology. However, cellular standards have not been adopted uniformly around the world. Therefore, some cell phones may only work in one country and not operate in other countries. Other cell phones can use multiple standards and operate in many countries.

# 1.0 Introduction

# 1.1 Wireless and Cellular Data Network
# 1.1.1 Wireless Data Networks

The ability of a laptop, tablet, or cell phone to wirelessly connect to the internet has provided people with the freedom to work, learn, communicate, and play wherever they want.

Mobile devices typically have two wireless internet connectivity options:

- **Wi-Fi** - Wireless network connections use local Wi-Fi settings.
- **Cellular** - Wireless network connections are fee-provided using cellular data. Cellular networks require cellular towers and satellites to create a mesh of global coverage. A cellular data network connection can become expensive without an appropriate service plan.

You may need to register a device with a carrier or provide some unique identifier. Every mobile device has a unique 15-digit number called an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This number identifies the device to a carrier's network. The numbers come from a family of devices called the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The number is found in the device's configuration settings or a battery compartment if the battery is removable.

A unique number called the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) identifies the device user. The IMSI is often programmed on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card or can be programmed on the mobile device itself, depending on the network type.

Wi-Fi is usually preferred over a cellular connection because it is typically free. Wi-Fi radios use less battery power than cellular radios, so the device battery should last longer using Wi-Fi.

Many businesses, organizations, and locations also offer free Wi-Fi connections to attract customers. For example, coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, and even public transportation may offer free Wi-Fi access to users. Educational institutions have also adopted Wi-Fi connectivity. For instance, college campuses enable students to connect their mobile devices to the college network, sign up for classes, watch lectures, and submit assignments.

# 1.1.2 Wi-Fi Manual Configuration

It is essential to secure home Wi-Fi networks. Precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices:

- Enable security on home networks. Always enable the highest Wi-Fi security framework possible. Currently, WPA2 or WPA3 security is the most secure.
- Never send login or password information using clear, unencrypted text.
- Use a secure VPN connection when possible.

Devices can connect automatically or manually to Wi-Fi networks.

# 1.1.3 Lab-Mobile Wi-Fi
# 1.1.4 Cellular Communications Standards

Cell phones were introduced in the mid-1980s. Back then, cell phones were bigger and bulkier. It was also difficult and expensive to call people on another cellular network because there were few industry standards for cellular technology. Without standards, interoperability between cell phone manufacturers was very difficult.

Industry standards have simplified interconnectivity between cell providers. These standards have also made it less expensive to use cellular technology. However, cellular standards have not been adopted uniformly around the world. Therefore, some cell phones may only work in one country and not operate in other countries. Other cell phones can use multiple standards and operate in many countries.

1. 1G
Introduced in the 1980s, first generation (1G) standards used analog standards. However, analog systems were prone to noise and interference which made it difficult to get a clear voice signal. Few 1G devices are in use today.

2. 2G

Introduced in the 1990s, the second generation (2G) standards switched from analog to digital standards. 2G provided speeds up to 1 Mb/s and supported higher call quality. 2G also introduced Short Message Service (SMS) which is used for text messaging and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) which is used for sending and receiving photos and videos.

3. 3G

Introduced in the late 1990s, third-generation (3G) standards enabled speeds up to 2 Mb/s to support mobile internet access, web browsing, video calls, video streaming, and picture sharing.


4. 4G

Introduced in the late 2000s, 4G standards enables speeds of 100 Mb/s and up to 1Gb/s. 4G supports gaming services, high-quality video conferencing, and high-definition television. 4G technology is commonly available with Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE adds improvements to 4G.

5. 5G

Introduced in 2019, 5G is the latest standard. It is more efficient than previous standards and may support speeds up to 20 Gb/s.

**NOTE :** Many cell phones can also support multiple standards to enable backward compatibility. For instance, many cell phones support 4G and 5G standards. The cell phone will use 5G when available. If a 5G network is no longer public, it will automatically switch to 4G without losing connection.

# 1.1.5 Airplane Mode

It may be required for you to disable your cellular access. For instance, airlines typically ask their passengers to disable cellular access. Most mobile devices have a setting called Airplane Mode to simplify this process. This setting turns off all cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth radios.

Airplane Mode is useful when traveling on an airplane or when located where accessing data is prohibited or expensive. Most mobile device functions are still usable, but communication is not possible. Once airplane mode can be turned on, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless functionality can be turned on except for cellular. You can also enable or disable cellular access. The two figures display the screens to turn Airplane Mode on or off on an iOS device and the screen to enable or disable cellular access on an iOS.

# 1.1.6 Hotspot

Another useful cellular feature is using a cellular device as a hotspot. A hotspot is when a cellular device provides an internet connection to other devices. The Wi-Fi devices could select the cellular device at its Wi-Fi connection. For instance, a user may need to connect a computer to the internet, but no Wi-Fi or wired connection is available. A cell phone can bridge the internet through the cellular carrierâ€™s network.

To enable an iOS device to become a personal hotspot, touch Personal Hotspot as shown below in the figure on the left. This opens the Personal Hotspot shown in the figure on the right. Notice how the iOS Personal Hotspot feature can connect Bluetooth or USB-connected devices to the internet.

**Note:** A hotspot is sometimes referred to as tethering.

Finally, there are apps available for mobile devices that can be useful tools when diagnosing mobile device radio problems. For instance, a Wi-Fi analyzer can display information about wireless networks, while a cell tower analyzer can be used on cellular networks.

# 1.1.7 Check Your Understanding - Wireless Technology

# 1.2 Bluetooth
# 1.2.1 Bluetooth for Mobile Devices

- Wireless Speaker
This is a portable mobile speaker that connects to mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system.

- Wireless Headphones
This is high-quality Bluetooth headphones for listening to music. Some also include a microphone and can be used as a hands-free headset for making and receiving telephone calls.

- Wireless Keyboard or Mouse
Some mobile devices can pair up with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to make input easier.

- Wireless Gaming Controller
Bluetooth game controllers can be paired to mobile devices.


# 1.2.2 Bluetooth Pairing

Bluetooth is a networking standard consisting of the physical and protocol levels. The physical level for Bluetooth is a radio frequency standard. Devices connect to other Bluetooth-enabled devices at the protocol level, called Bluetooth pairing. At the protocol level, devices agree on the timing, method, and comparison of sent bits. 

Specifically, Bluetooth pairing is when two Bluetooth devices establish a connection to share resources. Bluetooth radios must be turned on for the devices to pair, and one device begins searching for other devices. Other devices must be set to discoverable mode, also called visible, so that they can detect them.

When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it transmits Bluetooth and device information such as device name, services that the device can use, Bluetooth class, and device name.

A PIN may be requested to authenticate the pairing process during the pairing process, as shown in the figure. The PIN is often a number but can also be a numeric code or passkey. The PIN is stored using pairing services, so it does not have to be entered the next time the device tries to connect. This is convenient when using a smartphone headset because it is paired when turned on within range.

# 1.3 Email Configuration
# 1.3.1 Introducton to Email

We all use email but never really think about how email actually works. The email structure relies on email servers and email clients. Select each for more information.

**Note:** This section focuses on email clients for mobile devices.

1. Email Servers
Email Servers
- Responsible for forwarding email messages sent by their users.
- Servers forward emails to other email servers.
- Servers store emails until retrieved by users.

2. Email Clients
Email Clients
- Clients connect to the email servers to retrieve their emails.
- Users utilize email clients to compose, read and manage their messages.
- Email clients can be web-based or standalone applications.
- Standalone email clients are platform dependent.

Email clients and servers use various protocols and standards to exchange emails. 

Popular email protocols and standards
1. POP3
Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)
- This is an email client protocol that is used to retrieve emails from a remote server over TCP/IP.
- It enables a client to connect to an email server, download the user email from the server, and then disconnect.
- POP3 typically does not leave a copy of the email on the server.
- POP3 uses TCP port 110.
- Compare with IMAP.
3. IMAP
Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP)
- Email client similar to POP3 except that it synchronizes email folders between the server and client and downloads copies of the email from the email server.
- IMAP is faster than POP3 but requires more disk space and more CPU resources.
- It is often used in large networks, such as a university campus.
- The most recent version of IMAP is IMAP4 and it uses TCP port 143.
- Compare with POP3.
4. SMTP
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Email clients use SMTP to send email to servers.
- Email servers also use SMTP to send emails to other email servers.
- A message is sent only after recipients are identified and verified.
- SMTP is text-based and uses only ASCII encoding and requires MIME to send all other file types.
- SMTP uses TCP port 25.
5. MIME
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME)
- MIME is normally used in conjunction with SMTP.
- Mime extends the text-based email format to include other formats, such as pictures and word processor documents.
6. SSL
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
- SSL was developed to transmit files securely.
- Most email clients and servers support encryption of emails.

Email servers require email software such as Microsoft Server Exchange. Exchange is also a contact manager and calendaring software. It uses a proprietary messaging architecture called Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI). The Microsoft Office Outlook client uses MAPI to connect Exchange servers to provide email, calendar, and contact management.

Email clients have to be installed on a mobile device. Many clients are configurable using a wizard. However, you still need to know key information to set up an email account. The table lists the information required to set up an email account.

|Email Account Information|Description|
|---|--|
|Email Address|This is the address people need to send email to you.<br> An email address is a username followed by the @ symbol and the domain of the email server (user@example.net).|
|Display name|This can be your real name, nickname, or any name that you want people to see.|
|Email protocols|Email protocols are used by the incoming mail server.<br> Different protocols provide different email services.|
|Incoming and Outgoing mail server names|These names are provided by the network administrator or ISP.|
|Account Credentials|This consists of the username that is used to log in to the mail server and the account password. <br> Always use strong passwords.|

# 1.3.2 
# 1.3.3 Android Email Configuration

Android devices are capable of using advanced communication applications and data services. Many of these applications and features require using web services provided by Google.

When you configure an Android mobile device for the first time, you are prompted to sign in to your Google account with your Gmail email address and password. Signing in to your Gmail account makes the Google Play store, data and settings backup, and other Google services accessible. The device synchronizes contacts, email messages, apps, downloaded content, and additional information from Google services. If you do not have a Gmail account, you can use the Google account sign-in page to create one.

Use the following steps to add an email account on an Android device.

**Step 1.** Touch the Email or the Gmail app icon.
**Step 2.** Choose the type of account (i.e., Google/GMAIL, Personal, or Exchange), and tap NEXT.
**Step 3.** Enter the device's passcode if needed.
**Step 4.** Enter the email address you want to use and the password.
**Step 5.** Tap Create New Account.
**Step 6.** Enter your first name, last name, email address, and password.
**Step 7.** Provide a phone number for account recovery purposes (optional).
**Step 8.** Review the account information and tap Next.

**Note:** If you want to restore Android settings to a tablet that you have previously backed up, you must sign in to the account when setting up the tablet for the first time. You cannot restore your Android settings if you sign in after the initial setup.

After the initial setup, access your mailbox by touching the Gmail app icon. Android devices also have an email app for connecting to other email accounts, but it simply redirects the user to the Gmail app in later versions of Android.

# 1.3.4 iOS Email Configuration

iOS devices ship with a stock Mail app that can handle multiple email accounts simultaneously. The Mail app supports several different email account types, including iCloud, Yahoo, Gmail, AOL, Outlook.com, and Microsoft Exchange.

An Apple ID is required to set up an iOS device. An Apple ID accessed the Apple App Store, the iTunes Store, and iCloud. iCloud provides email and the ability to store content on remote servers. The iCloud email is free and offers remote storage for backups, mail, and documents.

All iOS devices, apps, and content link to your Apple ID. When an iOS device is activated for the first time, the Setup Assistant guides you through connecting the device and signing in with or creating an Apple ID. The Setup Assistant also allows you to create an iCloud email account. During the setup process, you can restore settings, content, and apps from a different iOS device from an iCloud backup.

Use the following steps to add an email account on an iOS device.

**Step 1.** Select **Settings > Passwords & Accounts > Add Account.**
**Step 2.** Tap the account type (i.e., iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo, AOL, or Outlook).
**Step 3.** If the account type is not listed, touch Other.
**Step 4.** Enter the account information.
**Step 5.** Touch **Save.**

# 1.3.5 Intenet Email

Many people have multiple email addresses. For instance, you may have a personal email account and a school or work account.

The email service provided uses either:

**Local email** - A local IT department manages the email server, such as a school network, business network, or organizational network.
**Internet email** - The email service is hosted on the internet and controlled by a service provider such as Gmail.
Users can access their online mailboxes using the following:

Default mobile email app included in the OS, such as iOS Mail.
Browser-based email clients, such as Mail or Outlook.
Mobile email client apps, including Gmail and Yahoo.
Email client apps provide a better user experience when compared to the web interface.

# 1.4 Mobile Device Synchronization
# 1.4.1 Types of Data to Synchronize

Many people use a combination of desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone devices to access and store information. It is helpful when specific information is the same across multiple devices. For example, when scheduling appointments using a calendar program, each new appointment would need to be entered into each device to ensure that each device is up to date. Data synchronization eliminates the need to make changes to every device.

Data synchronization is the exchange between two or more devices while maintaining consistent data on those devices.

Synchronization methods include synchronization to the cloud, a desktop, and an automobile.

There are many different types of data to synchronize:

- Contacts
- Applications
- Email
- Pictures
- Music
- Videos
- Calendar
- Bookmarks
- Documents
- Location data
- Social media data
- E-books
- Passwords

# 1.4.2 Enabling Synchronizaton

Sync typically means data synchronization. However, the meaning of sync varies slightly between an Android and an iOS device.

Android devices can synchronize your contacts and other data from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. As a result, all devices using the same Google account will have access to the same data. This makes it easier to replace a damaged device without data loss. Android Sync also allows the user to choose the data types to synchronize.

Android devices also support automatic synchronization with a feature called Auto Sync. This synchronizes the device with the service provider's servers automatically, without user intervention. To save on battery life, you can disable automatic synchronization for all or just some of the data.

The following are the various steps to synchronize an Android device.

To review what data to synchronize on an Android device.

Step 1. Open your device's Settings app.
Step 2. Tap Accounts and backup > Manage accounts.
Step 3. If you have more than one account on your device, tap the one you want.
Step 4. Tap Sync account.
Step 5. Review the data to be synchronized and when they last synced. You can enable or disable which apps to sync.

To disable auto-sync on an Android device.

Step 1. Open your device's Settings app.
Step 2. Tap Accounts and backup > Manage accounts.
Step 3. Disable Auto-sync data.


iOS devices support two types of synchronizing:

Backup - Copies your data from your phone to your computer or iCloud. That includes application settings, text messages, voicemails, and other data types. Backup saves a copy of all data created by the user and by apps.
Sync - Copies new apps, music, video, or books from iTunes to your phone and from your phone to iTunes, resulting in full synchronization on both devices. Sync copies only media downloaded via the iTunes Store mobile app, respecting what was specified through iTunes' Sync definitions. For example, a user can keep movies from syncing to the phone if the user does not watch movies on the phone.
As a general rule, when connecting an iOS device to iTunes, always perform a Backup first and then Sync. The order can be changed in iTunes' Preferences.

A few more useful options are available when performing Sync or Backup on iOS:

Backup storage location - iTunes stores backups on the local computer hard drive or the iCloud online service.
Backup straight from an iOS device - In addition to backing up data from an iOS device to the local hard drive or iCloud through iTunes, users can configure the iOS device to upload a copy of its data directly to iCloud. Backups can perform automatically, eliminating the need to connect to iTunes. Similar to Android, the user can also specify the type of data sent to the iCloud backup, as shown in the figure.
Sync over Wi-Fi - iTunes can scan and connect to iOS on the same Wi-Fi network. When connected, the Backup process can be initiated automatically between iOS devices and iTunes. Backups happen automatically every time iTunes and the iOS device are on the same Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for a wired USB connection.
 
When a new iPhone connects to the computer, iTunes will offer to restore it using the most recent backup of data from other iOS devices, if available. The figure below shows the iTunes window on a computer.

# 1.4.3 Synchronization Connection Types

The devices use USB and Wi-Fi connections to synchronize data between devices.

Most Android devices do not have a desktop program for performing data synchronization. Therefore, most users sync with Googleâ€™s different web services, even when synchronizing with a desktop or laptop computer. One benefit of synchronizing data using this method is that the data is accessible from any computer or mobile device at any time by signing in to a Google account. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that it can be challenging to synchronize data with programs installed locally on a computer, such as Outlook for email, calendar, and contacts.

iOS devices can also use Wi-Fi Sync to synchronize with iTunes. An iOS device must first synchronize with iTunes using a USB cable to use Wi-Fi Sync. It would help if you also turned on Sync over Wi-Fi Connection in the Summary pane of iTunes, as shown in the figure. After that, you can use Wi-Fi Sync or a USB cable. When the iOS device is on the same wireless network as the computer running iTunes and using a power source, it automatically synchronizes with iTunes.

Microsoft also offers cloud storage for synchronizing data between devices through OneDrive. OneDrive is also able to synchronize data between mobile devices and PCs.
